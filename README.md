# Nix Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles, which are managed with Nix and
Home Manager.

For installation, clone this repo to `.config/home-manager` and use the given
scripts in `misc`; you can also use them as a reference for manual install.

The expected environment for this is currently a minimal Arch install; the
scripts will set up a full environment from that. This might change in the
future to NixOS.
